# Yummy Fingerfood

A simple restaurant website created with Django. It features:

- User app with registration, authentication and profile
- Menu app
- Ordring app
- API endpoints
- Custom User Model
- Test Cases

The API endpoint is intended to be integrated with a front-end framework (such as React) if the need arises later on.
